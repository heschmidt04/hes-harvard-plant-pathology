('Healthy', 'An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the genome of the fruit was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.[3]','Treatment varies according to pests and diseases. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Pests_and_diseases','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple');

('Scab', 'Apple scab is a common disease of plants in the rose family (Rosaceae) that is caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis.[1] While this disease affects several plant genera, including Sorbus, Cotoneaster, and Pyrus, it is most commonly associated with the infection of Malus trees, including species of flowering crabapple, as well as cultivated apple.[2][3] The first symptoms of this disease are found in the foliage, blossoms, and developing fruits of affected trees, which develop dark, irregularly-shaped lesions upon infection.[4][5] Although apple scab rarely kills its host, infection typically leads to fruit deformation and premature leaf and fruit drop, which enhance the susceptibility of the host plant to abiotic stress and secondary infection.[6][5] The reduction of fruit quality and yield may result in crop losses of up to 70%, posing a significant threat to the profitability of apple producers.[6] To reduce scab-related yield losses, growers often combine preventive practices, including sanitation and resistance breeding, with reactive measures, such as targeted fungicide or biocontrol treatments, to prevent the incidence and spread of apple scab in their crops.[7]','Use a fungucide spray, not the insecticide.','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_scab');

('Rust', 
'On the apple tree, the infections occur on leaves, fruit and young twigs.[4] The brightly colored spots produced on the leaves make it easy to identify. Small, yellow-orange spots appear on the upper surfaces of the leaves, through April and June.[5] These spots gradually enlarge and turn orange or red and may show concentric rings of color. Drops of orange liquid may be visible on the spots. Later in the season, black dots appear on the orange spots on the upper leaf surface. In late summer, tube-like structures develop on the undersurface of the apple leaf. Infected leaves sometimes drop prematurely, particularly during drought conditions or when the tree is under additional stress. Infections on fruit are usually near the blossom end and are somewhat similar to the leaf lesions.',
'Because apples are an economically important crop, control is usually focused there. Interruption of the disease cycle is the only effective method for control of the cedar apple rust. The recommended method of control is to “remove cedars located within a 1 mile (1.6 km) radius” of the apples to interrupt the disease cycle,[8] though this method is seldom practical. For those doing bonsai, it is common to have the trees within feet of each other and on the central eastern seaboard of the United States, Eastern Red Cedar is a common first-growth conifer along roadsides.
There are differences in the susceptibility of various apple varieties. Jonathan, Rome Beauty, Wealthy, Stayman, Jonafree and York Imperial are susceptible.[9] Grimes Golden, Red Delicious, Winesap, Redfree, McIntosh, Liberty, and Priscilla are resistant.[9] Crabapples are generally more susceptible than apples. Resistant crabapples include Adams, Beverly, Candied Apple, Dolgo, Donald Wyman, Eleyi, Inglis, Indian Summer, Liset, Mt. Arbor, M. persicifolia, Red Jewel, Robinson, Robusta, Royalty, M. sargentii, Tina, Snowdrift, and Special Radiant. Resistant Crataegus (Hawthorn) include C. crus-galli, series Intricatae, C. laevigata, Autumn Glory, C. phaenopyrum, C. pruinosa, C. viridis, and Winter King. The resistant varieties are less susceptible to attack, but that does not mean that they are free from an aggressive attack.

Fungicide sprays applied in a timely manner are highly effective against the rust diseases during the apple cycle.[10] Most protective fungicide sprays are applied four times at 7- to 10-day intervals, starting with pink bud on crabapples. These applications are to protect the apples from spores being released from the cedar host in mid-spring. If cedar apple rust disease is diagnosed on apple fruits and leaves it is far too late to spray. Although curative fungicides also exist for cedar apple rust, they must still be applied before trees begin to develop symptoms.[11] Systemic fungicides are available as well, which require fewer sprays during the season.[12] 

However, there are no fungicides available to home gardeners that can be used on trees that produce fruit which will be eaten by people.[2]

Fungicides listed for use on apples can be used in July and August on the cedars to reduce infection. Application of fungicides to the junipers before and while they are in the infectious orange gelatinous state seems to reduce the severity of the outbreak.',

('Complex', 'Complex appears to be a combination of diseases for the Apple plant. So keep in mind the second diagnosis when looking to treat the apple tree','Apple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Nearly all commercial orchards pursue an aggressive program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which reduces needless spraying when pests are not present or are more likely to be controlled by natural predators.

Spraying for insect pests must never be done during flowering because it kills pollinators. Nor should bee-attractive plants be allowed to establish in the orchard floor if insecticides are used. White clover is a component of many grass seed mixes, and many bees are poisoned by insecticides while visiting the flowers on the orchard floor after a spraying.

Among the most serious disease problems are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, apple scab, and black spot, three fungal diseases.
The plum curculio is the most serious insect pest. Others include apple maggot and codling moth
Apples are difficult to grow organically, though a few orchards have done so with commercial success, using disease-resistant cultivars and the very best cultural controls. The latest tool in the organic repertoire is to spray a light coating of kaolin clay, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, and also helps prevent apple sun scald.','https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Apple#Pests_and_diseases');

('PowderyMildew', 'Powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic ascomycete Podosphaera leucotricha, is one of the major diseases of cultivated apple throughout the world. The primary host is apple, but other fruit like peaches and quince provide a host for Podosphaera leucotricha. [2] A list of host plants/species affected includes Cydonia oblonga (quince), Malus (apple), Prunus persica (peach), Prunus domestica (plum), Pyrus (pears), and Mespilus germanica (medlar).[3] On apples, the fungus affects twigs, foliage, blossoms, and fruits of current season growth.[2] Infected plants are characterized by reduced photosynthesis and transpiration, resulting suboptimal carbohydrate assimilation and reduced growth.[2]

Podosphaera leucotricha causes a range of symptoms. On stems, symptoms include wilting and discoloration. Wilting and leaf curling occur on leaves. Symptoms of the inflorescence include discoloration (non-graminous plants), dwarfing, stunting, and twisting. On fruit symptoms include net-like russeting and deformed fruit.[4][3] Depending on the stage in the disease cycle, symptoms vary. The primary blossom mildew emerges at pink bud stage. Flowers are deformed with pale green or yellow petal and are covered in white mycelium and spores.[5] The secondary mildew may have lesions that appear as chlorotic spots on the upper leaf surface. Symptoms of the secondary mildew also included distorted leaves and premature falling of leaves.[5]','Intensive applications of fungicides are usually used to control apple powdery mildew.[7] In the UK, most commercial apple orchards receive routine sprays.[5] This is because mildew is always present in the orchard and therefore routine chemical control measures are usually needed. Spraying occurs from green cluster until vegetative growth ceases, and occasionally post-harvest if terminal buds regrow.[5] Once primary mildew levels are high, effective control becomes difficult. Therefore, control strategies depend on maintaining primary mildew at a low level. When levels are high, prompt physical removal of blossoms or shoots may be the only effective way to reduce inoculum levels.[5] In organic orchards, control is based on a combination of cultural levels and fungicide use where possible, but sulphur is the only fungicide active against powdery mildew permitted for use in organic production.[5] Cultural levels are based on removal of primary inoculum by pruning. In winter, prune out silvered shoots. At pink bud and petal fall stages, prune out primary blossom and primary blossom and primary vegetative mildew.[7] There are times when controlling mildew is most important. June is a critical time for monitoring and mildew control as this is the period for rapid extension growth and also when fruit buds are forming and sealing for next spring.[5] Fungicides and cultural controls are the main ways to manage P. leucotricha, however the development of apple varieties displaying durable resistance to the fungi is one of the major aims of apple breeding programs worldwide.[6]','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podosphaera_leucotricha');

('FrogEyeLeafSpot', 
'In leaves the fungus begins by causing purple specks on infected leaves.[3] These then enlarge to cause large spots on the leaf, developing a brown color. The spots appear to have rings of brown with a purple margin, thus giving it its frogeye appearance. The spots can then produce pycnidia which can separate this species of fungus from other possible leaf fungi.[1]',
'The most effective treatment is to prune out the infected areas on trees, to ensure transfer between trees does not occur. Fruit that is infected can stay on the tree for over a year, and therefore remaining fruit should be removed to avoid another source of inoculation for other trees. The trimmed branches or dead fruit should then be burned or disposed of immediately as the organism can survive on the dead tissue for a long period of time. Infection of leaves and fruit can be avoided by spraying them with a fungicide. The treatment for the fungicide should be also kept up to date via the instructions from the manufacturer.[2]',
