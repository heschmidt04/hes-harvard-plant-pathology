( 'homemade fungicide','DIY Fungicides for the Garden Learning how to make your own fungicide gives you control of the ingredients, many of which are already in your home. Here are some of the more popular items for use in making fungicide for lawns and gardens:

Mixing baking soda with water, about 4 teaspoons or 1 heaping tablespoon , 20 mL to 1 gallon - 4 L. of water 
Note: many resources recommend using potassium bicarbonate as a substitute for baking soda [3]..
Dishwashing soap, without degreaser or bleach, is a popular ingredient for homemade plant fungicide.
Cooking oils are often mixed into homemade plant fungicide to make them cling to leaves and stems.
Pyrethrin leaves [4] that come from the painted daisy flower are widely used in commercial fungicide for plants. 
Grow your own painted daisies [5] and use the flowers as a fungicide for plants. 
Dry the flower heads, then grind them or soak overnight in 1/8 cup 29.5 mL of alcohol. 
Mix with up to 4 gallons 15 L. of water and strain through cheesecloth.
Bordeaux mixture [6] for use during the dormant season can control some fungal and bacterial diseases. 
You can make your own Bordeaux mix with ground limestone and powdered copper sulfate. 
The most recommended strength for dormant application is 4-4-50. 
Mix 4 parts of each with 50 gallons 189 L. of water. 
If you need less, like for a gallon, reduce the recipe for this homemade plant fungicide to 6.5 to 8 teaspoons , 32-39 mL of the copper sulfate and 3 tablespoons, 44 mL llimestone to 1 pint , .5 L. of water.

Using Organic Fungicide Recipes
Now that you’ve learned how to make your own fungicide, use it responsibly. 
The term organic leads some to believe that these mixtures are completely safe, which is untrue. 
Use all homemade fungicide for the lawn and garden carefully, especially around children and pets.

BEFORE USING ANY HOMEMADE MIX: It should be noted that anytime you use a home mix, you should always test it out on a small portion of the plant first to make sure that it will not harm the plant. Also, avoid using any bleach-based soaps or detergents on plants since this can be harmful to them. In addition, it is important that a home mixture never be applied to any plant on a hot or brightly sunny day, as this will quickly lead to burning of the plant and its ultimate demise.

( 'Pyrethrum','What is Pyrethrum?  Pyrethrum is a chemical extract containing two active compounds, pyrethrin I and pyrethrin II. In these forms, the chemical is directly derived from several different species of chrysanthemum [1] as well as the painted daisy [2]. Anything you find in a garden center has probably been highly refined for garden use. There is another group with a similar name, the pyrethroids, which are derived from pyrethrum, but are in all ways synthetic and not necessarily approved for organic gardens.

Natural pyrethrum spray causes death in insects by disrupting the ion channels in their bodies, resulting in an electrical overload in their nervous systems. Although organic, these chemicals are not selective and will kill any insect that comes into contact with them, including beneficial insects like ladybugs [3], lacewings [4], and bees [5]. Seventy-five percent of the chemical breaks down within 24 days in the soil, but may rapidly degrade when exposed to light or air.

Uses for Pyrethrum
Pyrethrum is a poison regardless of its organic status — it is very good at killing whatever insect it contacts. Because it breaks down rapidly when exposed to air and light, it can be applied in a way that shields beneficial insects [6] from danger, but gardeners absolutely must use this chemical properly and only apply it during the late evening, night, or very early in the morning, before bees are out foraging.

When using pyrethrum, take the same precautions you would with any chemical. Do not overuse this chemical – run-off into water supplies is extremely dangerous to fish and other aquatic species. Parasitoids, such as parasitic wasps [7], and general insect predators are at a moderate risk from pyrethrum. It does appear to be fairly safe for mammals, based on rat studies, but the long-term exposure risks are unknown. ','URLs in this post:

( 'sterol inhibitors','Classic fungicides that are used against apple scab, such as sterol inhibitors, are highly effective at controlling powdery mildew. These include myclobutanil and fenbuconazole. Since the fungus overwinters inside buds, you should start treating your tree early in the season before the blossoms start to show a pinkish color.
The failure to spray before the blooms opens is one of the most common mistakes made in controlling this disease according to the American Phytopathological Society.
Be sure and repeat the sprays at two to three week intervals until the new shoots stop growing. That could mean as many as 18 sprays if your cultivar is highly susceptible!
Also be sure to continue spraying even if the weather becomes dry. Unlike most other foliar pathogens, apple powdery mildew continues its growth and spore production in dry weather.

Prevention
You can also spray sulfur fungicides before the symptoms appear.
Be careful with sulfur. You can harm the plant if you apply it within two weeks of a chemical fungicide or if the temperatures are greater than 90°F.

( 'bordeaux mixture','This class of fungicides includes the classic Bordeaux mixture of copper sulfate and lime. 
This combination is highly effective at preventing powdery mildew and is certified organic. 
You can buy a pre-packaged mixture designed for small gardens.

Coat the apple tree trunk with Bordeaux mixture, a copper sulfate and calcium oxide in water. This helps to prevent a powdery mildew infection. Though fairly toxic, this method of prevention is considered organic.
The ultimate prevention technique is to plant resistant varieties! Some of the most popular cultivars are the most susceptible – Granny Smith, Jonathan, and Rome for example.
